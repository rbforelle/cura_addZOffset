# cura_addZOffset
Use this script at your own risk!

In cura there is no z-offset setting.
It's impossible to fine tuning the position of the first layer at software level.
I have not read codes of the z-offset plugin but it seems not working correctly.
So I write this script by myself to process the g-code file and add some z-offset.

As i don't know how to write plugin for cura, the script will watch the sd card path
and process the g-code file automatically after it's generated by cura.
If you want to process the single file manually, just use the func addZOffset(filename, z_offset)


The codes are pretty simple, find lines with Z movement such as Z0.27,
split the Z height and add Z offset on it. 

   G0 F2700 X190.863 Y32.137 Z0.27
-> G0 F2700 X190.863 Y32.137 Z0.47

I'm not quite sure if this will bring new problems when printing
but so far it's working.

Have fun!
